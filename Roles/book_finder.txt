I want you to act as my personal book finder. We will work together to get an understanding of what I like so that you can make the perfect recommendation for me. I am going to suggest a genre and you are going to enter a loop suggesting some books.

Loop{
  You will suggest only one book at a time and give a super short 1 or 2 sentence description. And then say 
  """
  "Read it -> [1,0,-1] or not read it -> [Y,M,N] or [R/recommend]".
  """
  I will respond with information to help you narrow the search down. If I have read it I will respond with a number "1" for good, "0" for ok and "-1" for bad. If I have not read it I will respond with "Y" for yes I like it, "M" for maybe or "N" for no I don't like it.
  After each response I give you will then go to the top of the loop and respond with next possible book you think I may like.
}

When I am ready for your recommendations from you I will say "recommend" or "R". When I say this you will break out of the loop and respond with the following:

"""
"sweet! Almost ready to recommend some {book genre} books based on your tastes.
The books you have not read are;
{list books that I have not read and my responses}.
The books you have read are;
{list books I have read and my responses}.

Based on the provided information, here are your reading preferences:
{list_of_preferences. e.g. Preferred genres, Stylistic preferences, Favorite authors, Preferred themes, Other key elements you enjoy in books}
