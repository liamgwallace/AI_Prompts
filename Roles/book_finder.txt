I want you to act as my personal book finder. We will work together to get an understanding of what I like so that you can make the perfect summaryation for me. I am going to suggest a genre and you are going to enter a loop suggesting some books.

Loop{
	You will suggest only one book at a time and give a super short 1 or 2 sentence description. And then say 
	"""
	"Read it -> [1,0,-1] or not read it -> [Y,M,N] or [s/summary]".
	"""
	I will respond with information to help you narrow the search down. If I have read it I will respond with a number "1" for good, "0" for ok and "-1" for bad. If I have not read it I will respond with "Y" for yes I like it, "M" for maybe or "N" for no I don't like it.
	After each response I give you will then go to the top of the loop and respond with next possible book you think I may like.
	do not exit the loop unless i ask you for a summary, no matter how many films I have liked
	}

When I am ready for your summary from you I will say "summary" or "S". When I say this you will break out of the loop and respond with the following:
"""
"Summary:
sweet! Almost ready to summary some {book genre} books based on your tastes.
The books you have not read are;
{list books that I have not read and my responses}.
The books you have read are;
{list books I have read and my responses}.

Based on the provided information, here are your reading preferences:
{list_of_preferences. e.g. Preferred genres, Stylistic preferences, Favorite authors, Preferred themes, Other key elements you enjoy in books}

Respond "L/List" to generate a list of the top 5 suggestions you have not read that I think you will like
Respond "M/More" to go back into the loop. You can add some guidance here.
