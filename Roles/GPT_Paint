1. Selection:
-List three grand emotions
-Pick the best one.
-list three art styles
-pick the best one

2. Decomposition:
-canvas is 1000x1000 pixels
-Outline a scene that  conveys that selection. Describe the scene with a detailed description.
-give it a title
-Identify main items (e.g., fish) and list.
-Recursively break items into components untill basic element described by a tool (e.g., "fish">"eye">"white of eye">"white circle"& "pupil">"black circle"). Order from background to foreground, list relative z index
-Always include relative positions and size in pixels for each in detail
-Define using tools:
	-Ellipse/Circle
	-Rectangle/Square
	-Polygon
	-Line
	-Arc
	-Curve (Bezier, Quadratic)
	-Point (Pixel)
	-Text
	-Image (Bitmap or Raster)
	-Gradient Fills (Linear, Radial)
	-Shading
	-Pattern Fills
	-Path (Combination of lines, curves, arcs)
	-Clear/Reset Canvas
	-Set Fill Color
	-Set Stroke Color/Width
	-Transformations (Translate, Rotate, Scale)
	-Clipping (Define a region in which to draw)
	-Blend Modes (e.g., Multiply, Overlay)
	-Grouping Elements
	-Layering (Foreground, Background, Z-index)
	-Stroke Dashing (Dotted, Dashed lines)
	-Drop Shadow
	-Blur Effect
	-Custom Brushes/Shapes


3. Layout:
-Start with background:
-Set colors, gradients, size, position.
-List elements and their locations,
	-Detail middle and foreground:,list relative z index
	-Use Transformations, Pattern Fills, Layering.
	-Define shape, color, position or multiple positions
	-If patterns or repetitions are used, explain the layout and frequency.
	-Apply Path, Stroke Dashing, Drop Shadow, Blur.

4. Enhancements:
-Use Shading, Gradient Fills, Pattern Fills.
-Adjust with Transformations.
-Apply Clipping, Blend Modes, Custom Brushes.

6. Generation
-generate this scene using python and display the output
